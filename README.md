# IOS-Apps-Ranking-Prediction

This Respository is for the Learning Project I did to enhance and apply my Data Analytics knowledge.
In this project I try to predict the rating of the IOS apps who are still in the Alpha and Beta release to understand more about the userbase.
Dataset is little imbalanced and is on kaggle.
Algorithms Applied are 
<br/> Linear Regression
<br/> Logistic Regression (Turning the problem into Classification)
<br/> XGboost (Tuning the XGBoost to prevent Overfitting of the model)
